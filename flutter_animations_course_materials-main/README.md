# Flutter Animations Course | Code With Andrea

This repo contains all the projects from my [Flutter Animations Course](https://nnbd.me/fa).

![Animations course banner](media/flutter-animations-course-banner.png)

The main project for this course is a Flutter habit tracking app, a (simplified) clone of the [Streaks App](https://streaksapp.com/).

## Projects structure

The entire course includes four [projects](projects/):

- **Colors / Numbers Game with Implicit Animations**: This is [located here](projects/colors_numbers_game_flutter) and covered in section 1
- **Flutter Intro Playground**: This is [located here](projects/intro_flutter_playground) and covered in section 1
- **Flutter Stopwatch App**: This is [located here](projects/stopwatch_flutter) and covered in section 2
- **Flutter Habit Tracking App**: This is [located here](projects/habit_tracker_flutter) and covered in sections 3 to 10 (rest of the course)

*Note: each commit in this project corresponds to a specific lesson in the course.*
